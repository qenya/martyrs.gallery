## <cite>AFRICA 21</cite>

**Exhibition: 7&ndash;27 July, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

Our July show is a group exhibition of photography that grew out of an interest in the burgeoning culture of African-based photojournalism, and an awareness that visual depictions of Africa have become mired in European and American perspectives of Africa and African society as &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;, as poor, as war-torn, as a repository of poorly managed natural beauty, etc. In turn, this militates against the production of images that depict Africa as a modern, developing continent.

<cite>Africa 21</cite> has been devised as a response to this narrative, bringing together work by <strong>photographers from Africa, of African origin or with connections to Africa</strong>, to reframe 21st century Africa as a mature, upwardly-mobile society &ndash; a continent that has come of age. We are particularly interested in showing photography that depicts African <strong>architecture, cities, fashion, design, technology, theatre and dance</strong>, but any work that explores themes of modern African society will be considered.

Photographers and photojournalists wanting their work to be considered for inclusion in <cite>Africa 21</cite> should submit <strong>up to four images</strong>, either by email to <a href="mailto:info@martyrs.gallery">info@martyrs.gallery</a> or via a filesharing website such as WeTransfer or Dropbox. Queries can be sent to the same email address. Image files should be in <strong>jpeg format only</strong> and will be reproduced at poster size for exhibition so should be at <strong>high resolution</strong> (as a guide, files should be around 2&ndash;5 MB in size). There is no charge for submitting work and submission of image files will be taken to express permission for the gallery to reproduce your photography for the purposes of the exhibition (and publicity for the exhibition) without fee.

The exhibition takes place from <strong>7 to 27 July 2018</strong> (gallery hours are Thursday to Sunday, 12 noon to 5pm). All photographers will be invited to attend a drinks reception and <strong>Private View on Friday 6 July</strong> 2018.

<strong>The closing date for submissions is midnight on Sunday 3 June 2018.</strong> Please ensure that all submissions are accompanied by a note of your contact details.
