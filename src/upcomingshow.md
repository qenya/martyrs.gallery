## CLIFF CRAWFORD: <cite>WAVEWORN</cite>

**First Friday Private View: Friday 2 March, 6pm
Exhibition: Saturday 3 March&ndash;Friday 23 March, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

Bexhill artist Cliff Crawford documents weathering and erosion on the Sussex coast through the medium of film and stills photography, catalogued by location and date to build up a complete and beautiful archive of change over the decades. <cite>Waveworn</cite> explores pressing issues of environmental instability, but also timeless human themes of change, impermanence and desire for (the illusion of) control.
