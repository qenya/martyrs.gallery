## NOW WE ARE 7: <cite>CHANGE &amp; DISRUPT</cite>

**Exhibition: Saturday 7 April &ndash; Friday 27 April, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

In 2016, women&rsquo;s art collective <cite>Now We Are 7</cite>, comprising artists Lyn Dale, Nikki Davidson-Bowman, Louise Michele Evans, Marie Ford, Stephanie Grainger, Jules Mitchell and Katy Oxborrow, set out on an experimental journey. Each artist made one piece of work and each month the work changed hands until each artist had contributed towards each piece. In a process of palimpsest, the work evolved or was reused or altered but potentially still bore visible traces of its earlier form. During the year of the project, the artists experienced their own changes and disruptions, in the form of relocation, separation, illness, loss and uncertainty. The result is a body of work that reflects themes of female identity, diversity and transition.

**Wednesday 28 March, 6&ndash;8pm**
