<p>A key fixture in the Martyrs&rsquo; calendar is the Summer Salon, an eclectic summer show presenting the best two- and three-dimensional work by both established and up-and-coming artists working in any medium.</p>

<p>The 2018 Summer Salon will take place during the Lewes Artwave Festival and exhibition dates are <strong>Saturday 18 August to Sunday 2 September, with a launch party and Private View on Friday 17 August, from 6pm</strong>. The Artwave Festival has around 30,000 visitors annually, so the Salon is an excellent showcase for local artists who are also holding their own open house or studio show, as well as being a significant selling opportunity for artists from further afield.</p>

<p>Artists wishing to be considered for inclusion in the Summer Salon are invited to submit <strong>up to four</strong> 2D or 3D works for consideration. Print/photography editions and unique originals are equally welcomed. Alternatively, <strong>one</strong> moving image submission may be made.</p>

<p>A PDF file containing full submission information can be downloaded <a href="/static/Summer%20Salon%20Submissions%202018.pdf" download="SummerSalonSubmissions2018.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The closing date for submissions is <strong>midnight at the end of Sunday 1 July 2018</strong>.</p>
