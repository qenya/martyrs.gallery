<p>A key fixture in the Martyrs&rsquo; calendar is the Summer Salon, an eclectic, juried, early summer show, presenting the best two- and three-dimensional work by both established and up-and-coming artists, and including a showcase spot for an artist of current interest.</p>

<p>The 2017 Summer Salon will take place from <strong>Saturday 8 to Sunday 30 July, with a Private View on Friday 7 July, 6&ndash;9pm,</strong> and our featured artist is Victor Stuart Graham, a Newhaven-based sculptor.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s jury comprises Alex Grey, Director of Martyrs&rsquo; Gallery and curator of the Summer Salon; Alex Leith, art aficionado and editor of <cite>Viva Lewes</cite> magazine; and John McSweeney, painter and writer, whose new collection, <cite>This England and Other Edens</cite>, will be showing at Martyrs&rsquo; in August.</p>

<p>Artists wishing to be considered for inclusion in the Summer Salon are invited to submit <strong>up to two</strong> 2D or 3D works for consideration. Print/photography editions and unique originals are equally welcomed. Alternatively, <strong>one</strong> moving image submission may be made.</p> 

<p>A PDF file containing full submission information can be downloaded <a href="/static/Summer%20Salon%20info.pdf" download="SummerSalonInfo.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The closing date for submissions is <strong>midnight at the end of Sunday 21 May 2017</strong>.</p>
