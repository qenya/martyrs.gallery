<p><strong>Friday 18 August&ndash;Sunday 3 September:</strong> Lewes Artwave! Over 100 galleries, artists&rsquo; studios and pop-up venues open their doors over three summer weekends to make the largest arts festival in the south-east. Make a day of it by following the various art trails around Lewes and our satellite villages. More, much more, information at <a href="https://www.artwavefestival.org/">www.artwavefestival.org</a>. <img src="/images/artwavegeneric.jpeg" alt="[Artwave]" class="inline" /></p>

<p><strong>September (date TBC):</strong> Artist Rachael Adams hosts a mini-symposium in conjunction with her work-in-progress, <cite>The Spinney: Landscapes of the Edgeland</cite>.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday 7 October, 12&ndash;2pm:</strong> Private View for Victor Bowley and Joyce Corbett&rsquo;s two-person exhibition, <cite>Ways of Seeing</cite>. All are invited to join us for a drinks reception to meet the artists and discuss their new work, which, while heavily abstracted, is redolent of the coastal environment in which they live and work. <br />
NB This Saturday reception replaces our usual First Friday event.</p>

<p><strong>Friday 3 November, 6&ndash;9pm:</strong> Join us for a very special Private View and be among the very first to see the Eastbourne Panels by early twentieth-century artist, art restorer and art historian EW Tristram. These exquisite works of art were rediscovered in 2016 and are now in the care of St Elisabeth&rsquo;s Church, Eastbourne, on whose behalf we will be fundraising tonight. <em>First Friday event.</em></p>

<p><strong>Saturday 4 November:</strong> Lewes Bonfire! The gallery will be closing at 2pm so that we can enjoy Lewes&rsquo;s annual festival of mayhem. Have a safe night!</p>

<p><strong>Thursday 7 December, to 9pm:</strong> As part of Lewes Late Night Shopping, Martyrs&rsquo; will be hosting the launch of our short writing anthology, which brings together a body of work created throughout the year by authors responding to the art shown in the gallery space. Join us for a live reading event and a glass of bubbly!</p>

<p><strong>Sunday 17 December, 12&ndash;5pm:</strong> Last day to see EW Tristram&rsquo;s Eastbourne Panels before the gallery closes for its annual January break. We wish you a restful holiday period and a very happy new year, and look forward to seeing you when we reopen on Saturday 10 February 2018.</p>
