These exquisite works of art were rediscovered in 2016 and are now in the care of St Elisabeth&rsquo;s Church, Eastbourne, on whose behalf we will be fundraising tonight. <em>First Friday event.</em></p>

<p><strong>Thursday 7 December, to 9pm:</strong> Special evening opening for Lewes Late Night Shopping.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday 17 December, 12&ndash;5pm:</strong> Last day to see EW Tristram&rsquo;s Eastbourne Panels before the gallery closes for its annual January break. We wish you a restful holiday period and a very happy new year, and look forward to seeing you when we reopen on Saturday 10 February 2018.</p>
