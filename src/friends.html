<p>We are beyond grateful for all the positive comments we receive in the gallery about the Martyrs’ vision and the art we are showing – they make all our hard work very worthwhile. So many of you have asked how you can support our continued existence that we’ve decided to start <strong>Friends of Martyrs’</strong> from this autumn. Friends of the gallery will have the opportunity to have their names displayed on our beautiful flagstone floor for the 2018 season, as well as priority booking for events and workshops, and an individual mention on the website. If you'd like to find out more about becoming a Friend then drop us a line at <a href="mailto:info@martyrs.gallery">info@martyrs.gallery</a>.</p>
