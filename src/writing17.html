<p>As part of our commitment to cross-pollination of the arts, Martyrs&rsquo; is sponsoring a year-long short writing competition.</p>

<p>Writers, who may be published or unpublished, are invited to submit a piece of fiction or non-fiction writing up to 5000 words long, inspired by any piece of art on display in the gallery during 2017. Submissions will be considered for publication in an anthology to be published by Martyrs&rsquo; Press in December 2017. Writers whose work is selected for the anthology will be invited to participate in a live reading event on Thursday 7 December.</p>

<p>Terms and conditions:</p>

	<li>Writers must be aged 18 or over.</li>
	<li>Writers may be published or unpublished, but the submitted work must not have been published or offered for publication elsewhere.</li>

However, writers whose work is inspired by art shown earlier in the year need not wait until the closing date is imminent to make their submission. All writers will be contacted as soon as possible after the closing date as to whether or not their work has been selected for publication.</li>
