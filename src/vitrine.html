<p>The Vitrine is our window-based experimental gallery in Eastbourne. Here, our interns, who are generally art students or creatives-in-training, have free rein to experiment with curated projects of their own, which we launch and celebrate several times a year with invitation-only Private Views.</p>

<p>For more information about internships or Vitrine projects, email Alex Grey at <a href="mailto:alex@martyrs.gallery">alex@martyrs.gallery</a>.</p>
