<p>Martyrs&rsquo; Gallery and Project Space is a new visual arts venue situated in Lewes, East Sussex, specialising in contemporary work by emerging and mid-career artists, especially mature artists who have changed career or direction. We show work in a wide variety of media, and embrace experimental or challenging projects driven by the critical practice of professional artists. We appreciate the theatrical quality of good art and its capacity to move, transport and entertain.</p>

<p>The gallery&rsquo;s programme has an emphasis on art that explores political, cultural or social ideas, and we aim to honour our own social values by offering fair access to opportunities for artists and staff, and through an ongoing commitment to our community.</p>

<p>We are proud of our position within the vibrant Sussex coast arts nexus, and of our connection with Lewes&rsquo;s independent-minded culture. The gallery is named for the town&rsquo;s 17 Marian Martyrs, whose determination to stand by their beliefs is still commemorated some three and a half centuries after their deaths.</p>
