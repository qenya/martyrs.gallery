# Please help us to save <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>!

<cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite> is unique among Hans Feibusch murals, in that it was a non-commissioned autobiographical project. As such, it is not only a rare example of British Holocaust art, but also a disturbing visual record that has enormous resonance in the context of modern anxieties about the displacement of refugees from conflict zones and the position of the British people in the history of diaspora. It is also a work of great spiritual significance and a registered war memorial. Properly preserved, interpreted and displayed, it has the potential to be a powerful educational tool in the service of peace.

<cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite> is currently hidden away from public view in the Crypt of St Elisabeth&rsquo;s Church, Eastbourne, which is scheduled for demolition.

## The mural

Hans Feibusch was a Jewish refugee who fled Germany for Britain in the 1930s, his work sufficiently despised by the Nazi regime to be included in the now infamous <cite>Entartete Kunst</cite> (Degenerate Art) exhibition of 1937, alongside artists such as Chagall, Kandinsky, Klee and Mondrian. He became a member of the London Group, which had been founded by artists including Walter Sickert and Jacob Epstein and went on to include most of the key names in twentieth-century British art, and found his niche fulfilling commissions to paint murals in churches and other public buildings. It was through this work that he came to the attention of Charles Reilly, the renowned professor of architecture, and George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, who provided him with the rare opportunity to create a mural of his own design and conception in the crypt at St Elisabeth&rsquo;s Church in Eastbourne in 1944.

Feibusch chose the allegory of <cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite> as a vehicle for his own story, depicting a refugee fleeing the evil and chaos of Nazi Germany and his eventual acceptance and redemption not in the Celestial City but in 1940s Britain. As well as being an extraordinary feat both in terms of its scale and its mastery of form and colour, <cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite> is also a deeply personal project unlike any other of Feibusch&rsquo;s work, and an important artefact in twentieth-century social history. Descendants of concentration camp detainees who have seen it say that those depicted in the mural bear the unmistakable facial expressions of Holocaust survivor guilt. The mural is a registered War Memorial (the first, we believe, of WW2) and is unusual in being dedicated to civilians as well as military casualties. As we embark on the twenty-first century, it acquires new resonance in the context of mass displacement of people into Europe by conflicts further afield.

## The story so far

Following many years of concern about the structural integrity of the church building, the church was closed in 2002 and the congregation moved next door to a newer building that had previously been used as a parish hall. Various schemes have been contemplated that would develop the building whilst keeping its exterior intact, but none have come to fruition. Meanwhile the church building has continued to deteriorate and its development or restoration have become less and less viable.

On 4 December 2017, the Church Commissioners of the Church of England published a draft Scheme providing for the demolition of the building. If approved, the Scheme would have allowed the Church to go ahead with demolition irrespective of whether the mural was still <i>in situ</i>.

Thanks to the swift and heartfelt action of many, many lovers of art, history and heritage, who wrote in impassioned terms to the Church Commissioners, that Scheme currently remains on hold.

***Thank you to everyone who participated in the letterwriting campaign and helped prevent the demolition plans being rubber-stamped.***

In February 2018, while the British Forces Broadcasting Company was filming in the Crypt in connection with this campaign, it became apparent that the mural had been vandalised with graffiti. It was also clear that the building&rsquo;s humidity and lack of ventilation were accelerating its deterioration. With time therefore of the essence, we prioritised the search for a new home for the mural and sources of funding for removing it safely.

On 17 April 2018, in recognition of the depth of feeling about <cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite>, an open afternoon was held at St Elisabeth&rsquo;s to allow the mural to be on general public display for the first time in some years. Huge numbers of visitors came, some having travelled hundreds of miles to be there. The event was covered by the local press and radio, and in an extended report on BBC News South East that day.

***Thank you to everyone who came and enjoyed the mural, which showed the Church Commissioners how valued and valuable it is.***

In April we also submitted a report to the Church Commissioners summarising our research into possible locations to which the mural could be moved. We identified three local possibilities, and outlined a plan for financing its removal. Since then, a fourth possible location for the mural has also been identified.

During September, our art conservation expert will be checking on the current condition of the mural.

## What next?

After a long delay, we are on the brink of receiving a decision about the Church of England&rsquo;s plans for St Elisabeth&rsquo;s, and by extension <cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite>. The Church Buildings (Uses and Disposals) Committee will consider all the representations made by the public, both for and against demolition, and the views of the Bishop of Chichester will also be sought. At the next meeting of the Committee, a selection of those who made representations may be allowed to speak briefly, after which a decision will be announced before the meeting is closed. There are four possible outcomes of this process:

* Plans for demolition may be abandoned, either until the mural is rescued or permanently.
* A decision about what to do may be deferred to a future meeting.
* The plan to demolish may be approved, but with a finite time-delay built in to allow us to rescue the mural.
* The plan to demolish may be approved for immediate actioning.

If we are unhappy with the decision the Church Buildings (Uses and Disposals) Committee makes, our only remaining recourse would be to appeal to the Privy Council for a judicial review of the decision-making process.

## How you can help

At this time, we are not asking for direct action by the public. However, you can still help in a number of ways.

* Join our mailing list by emailing us at <a href="mailto:savethemural@martyrs.gallery">savethemural@martyrs.gallery</a> with &lsquo;Mural&rsquo; in the subject line. We will email you periodically with news or calls to action. We will store your email address securely and adhere to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation 2018.
* We need to raise approximately £300,000 to relocate the mural. We have a plan for financing the project but all offers of help will be most gratefully received. Please email us if you are a professional grantwriter or fundraiser, or if you have links to a grantmaking trust or a corporate or philanthropic giving programme.
* We already have four potential locations in mind for the mural, but if you know of anywhere else, then do get in touch. The mural is big! It occupies around 40 metres of wall space in the St Elisabeth&rsquo;s Crypt, but will be on panels once removed and can be displayed more flexibly than at present.
* If you are a solicitor who is able to offer us <i>pro bono</i> legal advice, then we would love to hear from you. We need to set up a charitable trust and may need advice in the event of an appeal for judicial review.

Any questions, comments, media requests or offers of help can be sent to me, Alex Grey, at <a href="mailto:alex@martyrs.gallery">alex@martyrs.gallery</a>.
