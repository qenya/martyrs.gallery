## CLIFF CRAWFORD: <cite>WAVEWORN</cite>

**First Friday Private View: Friday 2 March, 6pm  
Exhibition: Saturday 3 March–Friday 23 March, 12 noon–5pm (Thu–Sun)**

Bexhill artist Cliff Crawford documents weathering and erosion on the Sussex coast through the medium of film and stills photography, catalogued by location and date to build up a complete and beautiful archive of change over the decades. <cite>Waveworn</cite> explores pressing issues of environmental instability, but also timeless human themes of change, impermanence and desire for (the illusion of) control.

## NOW WE ARE 7: <cite>CHANGE &amp; DISRUPT</cite>

**First Friday Private View: Friday 6 April, 6pm  
Exhibition: Saturday 7 April–Friday 27 April, 12 noon–5pm (Thu–Sun)**

In 2016, women’s art collective Now We Are 7, comprising artists Lyn Dale, Nikki Davidson-Bowman, Louise Michele Evans, Marie Ford, Stephanie Grainger, Jules Mitchell and Katy Oxborrow, set out on an experimental journey. Each artist made one piece of work and each month the work changed hands until each artist had contributed towards each piece. In a process of palimpsest, the work evolved or was reused or altered but potentially still bore visible traces of its earlier form. During the year of the project, the artists experienced their own changes and disruptions, in the form of relocation, separation, illness, loss and uncertainty. The result is a body of work that reflects themes of female identity, diversity and transition.

## TOM HOMEWOOD: <cite>NEW PAINTINGS</cite>

**Private View: Friday 4 May, 6pm  
Exhibition: 5–25 May, 12 noon–5pm (Thu–Sun)**

In a Martyrs’ exclusive, Lewes artist Tom Homewood unveils his 2018 collection of oil paintings, including the beautiful but haunting Sussex landscapes for which he is already known as well as a strand of experimental work on show for the first time. 

## PATRICIA THORNTON: <cite>MAPS AND DREAMS</cite>

**Private View: Friday 1 June, 6pm  
Exhibition: 2–22 June, 12 noon–5pm (Thu–Sun)**

A former <cite>FRESH AiR</cite> artist-in-residence, painter Pat Thornton has built her new collection around news media images of conflict and displacement to explore the interplay between journeys both literal and figurative.

## <cite>AFRICA 21</cite>

**Private View: Friday 6 July, 6pm  
Exhibition: 7–27 July, 12 noon–5pm (Thu–Sun)**

Rejecting the clichéd roles imposed upon the continent of Africa by Western culture and media, <cite>Africa 21</cite> is a group exhibition of photography that reframes 21st century Africa as a mature, upwardly-mobile destination as well as a naturally beautiful one – a continent that has come of age.

<cite>Africa 21</cite> is generously supported by Cedarberg Travel.
