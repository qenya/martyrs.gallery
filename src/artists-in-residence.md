## CALL FOR PROPOSALS – <cite>FRESH AiR 18</cite>

Once again, Martyrs’ Gallery and Project Space in Lewes will be kicking off the year’s programme with <cite>FRESH AiR</cite>, a series of one-week micro-residencies in February 2018, offering the opportunity to explore new, experimental or large-scale work in the gallery.

Artists, or, exceptionally, groups of artists, may use the space (approx. 5m x 7m) undisturbed for up to 5 days (Mon–Fri), to create, curate or install, and must then be willing to present their work or work-in-progress to the public for one weekend. <cite>FRESH AiR</cite> artists will also be considered for inclusion in the gallery’s main exhibition programme for 2019 and beyond.

Previous <cite>FRESH AiR</cite> artists have included Diana Burch, Patricia Thornton, Rachael Adams, Robert Littleford, Andrew James, Alex Julyan, Francesca Duffield and Nikki Davidson-Bowman.

Please email a brief synopsis of proposed work together with any supporting material (images, CV, statement, etc.) in a **single PDF file** to Alex Grey at [alex@martyrs.gallery](mailto:alex@martyrs.gallery), indicating your preference, if any, out of the following slots: week ending **10/11 February**, **17/18 February** or **24/25 February**. Any questions/queries can also be emailed to alex@martyrs.gallery. Please put ‘Fresh Air – Proposal’ or ‘Fresh Air – Query’ in the subject line.

More information about Martyrs’ Gallery and Project Space can be found at [www.martyrs.gallery](https://www.martyrs.gallery/). 

**Closing date: 26 January 2018**
