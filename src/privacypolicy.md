## PRIVACY POLICY

We value our privacy so we think it&rsquo;s only fair that we respect yours too. The following is a summary of the information we hold about you and how we use it.

**Website**

When you visit our website, you do so anonymously. Our web server determines what sort of device you&rsquo;re using so as to optimise the appearance of our pages, but this information isn&rsquo;t saved or stored and we don&rsquo;t use cookies. We don&rsquo;t use software to analyse visitor traffic data, partly because Martyrs&rsquo; is a largely non-commercial enterprise that very rarely tries to sell you anything, and partly because we&rsquo;re way too busy making, showing or talking about art to even think about what we would do with those statistics.

**Social media**

We maintain pages on Facebook and Twitter and if you visit, follow, subscribe to, like, share or retweet us, our pages or our posts, your activity will be monitored in line with the policy of those websites. We have no control over their capture or analysis of your data. If you are uncomfortable with their privacy policy, we completely understand and won&rsquo;t take it personally if you decline to engage with us via social media.

**Mailing list**

We maintain a mailing list for the purpose of sending monthly e-newsletters and occasional calls to action. Alex Grey, the Artistic Director of Martyrs&rsquo; Gallery, is the sole processor and controller of the mailing list. The mailing list comprises email addresses only and we do not store your name or any other data about you. You are not therefore individually identifiable unless your identity can already be inferred from the email address you use. If you are on our mailing list, it is because you have asked to be on it, either in person, in writing or by email; or because you have left your email address in our visitors book; or because your activities have intersected with ours in some way. The mailing list is stored securely in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and is not shared with or accessible by any third parties for any purpose. Subscribers to the mailing list have the option to unsubscribe at any time and with immediate effect, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@martyrs.gallery">info@martyrs.gallery</a>. This information is also provided in the footer of every e-newsletter. If you unsubscribe from the newsletter, your email address will be deleted from the mailing list with immediate effect and there will be no record of your having previously subscribed.

**Visitors book**

We maintain a hard-copy visitors book at the gallery, in which visitors are invited to sign their name and leave an email address and/or a comment about the exhibition they have visited. Our visitors book is a valuable source of feedback both to the gallery and to visiting artists and helps us to be responsive to your thoughts and opinions. If you visit the gallery you are under no obligation to write in the visitors book, and if you choose to do so you are under no obligation to include your email address. If you choose to leave your email address in the visitors book, you do so on the understanding that the visitors book is left open and unattended in a public place for substantial amounts of time. If you choose to leave your email address in the visitors book, we may add your email address to our mailing list.

If you have any questions or comments about this privacy policy or the data we hold about you, email us at <a href="mailto:info@martyrs.gallery">info@martyrs.gallery</a>.
