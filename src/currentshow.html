<p>Never before seen in public, Martyrs’ Gallery is delighted to present 
the exquisite Eastbourne Panels, created in 1938 by art historian and 
restorer Ernest William Tristram and gifted to St Elisabeth’s Church in 
Eastbourne, on whose behalf we are fundraising.</p>

<p>Please join us for a range of special events listed at 
<a href="http://www.martyrs.gallery/upcomingevents">www.martyrs.gallery/upcomingevents</a> and donate generously to this cause, 
which will support valuable arts initiatives as well as the local community.</p>

<p>The gallery will be available to book for study days on EW Tristrams&rsquo;s 
work throughout November and December for schools and other groups. 
Please email <a href="mailto:info@martyrs.gallery">info@martyrs.gallery</a> for availability and prices.</p>
