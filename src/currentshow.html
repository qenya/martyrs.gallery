<p>Never before seen in public, Martyrs’ Gallery is delighted to present

restorer Ernest William Tristram and gifted to St Elisabeth’s Church in 
Eastbourne, on whose behalf we are fundraising.</p>

<p>The gallery will be available to book for study days on EW Tristrams&rsquo;s 
work throughout November and December for schools and other groups.
