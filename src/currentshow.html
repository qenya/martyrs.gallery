<h2>RACHAEL ADAMS: THE SPINNEY: LANDSCAPES OF THE EDGELAND</h2>

<p><strong>Exhibition: Saturdays 9, 16, 23 &amp; 30 September, 12 noon–5pm</strong></p>

<p>Former FRESH AiR artist-in-residence Rachael Adams shares work-in-progress associated with her ongoing project The Spinney, which explores the role of the Edgeland – the often neglected wilderness where urban meets rural – and attempts to recreate the sense of wonder and freedom that accompanied stumbling upon such territory in childhood.</p>

<p>You can find out more about Rachael at <a href="http://scrutineer.co.uk/" title="Artist and Designer: Rachael Adams, The Scrutineer of Scrutineer's">www.scrutineer.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that there will be no First Friday Private View for this installation.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop: Sunday 24 September, 11am-3pm</strong></p>

<p>To coincide with The Spinney, art historian Dr Chris Mullen invites you to join him in a workshop at Martyrs’ Gallery exploring ‘Spirit of Place: Interpreting the Landscape’. After an introduction and a talk by Rachael Adams about her work <cite>The Spinney: Landscapes of the Edgeland</cite>, there will be an opportunity to discuss approaches to visualising and interpreting landscape. Topics include Demarcations and Borders, and the Cult of the Pastoral. Participants will be able to contribute to a contemporary taxonomy of landscape.</p>

<p>Morning session: 11.00am – 12.30pm <br />
Break for lunch (not provided) <br />
Afternoon session: 1.30pm – 3.00pm.</p>

<p>The workshop is free of charge but please email <a href="mailto:info@martyrs.gallery">info@martyrs.gallery</a> to book your place as the workshop is expected to be popular.</p>
