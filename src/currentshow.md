## <cite>SOMETHING GLOWING AND ALIVE</cite>: WORKS BY CHAGALL, PIPER &amp; SUTHERLAND

**Private View: Friday 9 November, 6pm**

**Exhibition: 10 November &ndash; 16 December, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

In association with Goldmark Gallery, we are delighted to present a vibrantly colourful exhibition of prints, lithographs and some original drawings and etchings  by Marc Chagal, John Piper and Graham Sutherland, three artists indelibly associated with Chichester Cathedral, having been commissioned to produce ecclesiastical art by Dean Walter Hussey during the 1960s and 1970s. Controversial in their time &ndash; all raised an eyebrow at the time of their installation, prompting a lone supporter of the Piper tapestries to protest that it was cheering to see &lsquo;something glowing and alive&rsquo; in the Cathedral &ndash; Chagall, Piper and Sutherland are now among the most collectible of twentieth-century artists and everything in the exhibition is for sale, together with a selection of recent stained glass by Patrick Reyntiens, John Piper&rsquo;s long-term collaborator.

**Martyrs&rsquo; Drawing Workshops: Wednesdays 14, 21 &amp; 28 November, 5 &amp; 12 December, 10.30am&ndash;3.30pm**

Join artists Pat Thornton and Rachael Adams every Wednesday throughout the exhibition for a practical drawing workshop inspired by Piper and Sutherland&rsquo;s neo-romanticism &ndash; a wartime tendency that combined an interest in the sublime aspects of romanticism with a  psychological sensibility &ndash; and exemplified by dramatic depictions of architectural ruins. Drawing from models, objects and &lsquo;prop&rsquo; set-ups, Pat and Rachael will show you how to use a variety of techniques and media to create moody, atmospheric 2D and 3D images. Workshops are stand-alone sessions but trace a progression through ideas and techniques if you book all five, and are suitable for all levels of experience. £35 per day or £150 for all five. Booking is essential as Pat’s workshops last winter inspired by the Tristram Panels were extremely popular.
