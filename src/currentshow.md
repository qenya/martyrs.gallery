## ALISON ALLUM: <cite>IN HER SHOES</cite>

**Exhibition: 5&ndash;25 May, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

Experimental glass artist Alison Allum exploits her medium&rsquo;s qualities of allure, fragility and danger to explore the contradictory experiences of modern womanhood. Combining classic beauty with a knowing theatricality, her collection of glass shoes and drawings portrays a much fetishised aspect of femininity and tempers it with an undercurrent of radicalism and wit.

**Friday 4 May, 6pm**

<cite>Private View:</cite> Refreshments from 6pm.

**Friday 11 &amp; 25 May, 10am&ndash;12 noon**

<cite>Martyrs&rsquo; Writing Group:</cite> Writers of fiction or non-fiction can use the gallery space free of charge for a calm, quiet, untutored drop-in session, inspired by the current exhibition (bring own materials and refreshments).
