## <em>OWING TO CIRCUMSTANCES OUTWITH OUR CONTROL, OUR JULY EXHIBITION HAS BEEN POSTPONED FOR THE TIME BEING. WE APOLOGISE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE GALLERY.</em>

## <cite>AFRICA 21</cite>

**Exhibition: 7&ndash;27 July, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

**Private View: Friday 6 July, 6pm**

Our July show is a group exhibition of photography that grew out of an interest in the burgeoning culture of African-based photojournalism, and an awareness that visual depictions of Africa have become mired in European and American perspectives of Africa and African society as &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;, as poor, as war-torn, as a repository of poorly managed natural beauty, etc. In turn, this militates against the production of images that depict Africa as a modern, developing continent.

<cite>Africa 21</cite> has been devised as a response to this narrative, bringing together work by photographers from Africa, of African origin or with connections to Africa, to reframe 21st century Africa as a mature, upwardly-mobile society &ndash; a continent that has come of age.

<cite>Africa 21</cite> is generously supported by Cedarberg Travel Africa.
