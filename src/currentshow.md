## <cite>CLIFF CRAWFORD: WAVEWORN &ndash; 15 Years in the Intertidal Zone
</cite>

**Saturday 3 March &ndash; Friday 23 March, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

Bexhill artist Cliff Crawford documents weathering and erosion on the Sussex coast through the medium of film and stills photography, catalogued by location and date to build up a complete and beautiful archive of change over the decades. Waveworn explores pressing issues of environmental instability, but also timeless human themes of change, impermanence and desire for (the illusion of) control.

**Friday 2 March, 6pm**

Private View: Refreshments from 6pm, plus talks by Cliff Crawford and Lara Band from [CITiZAN](www.citizan.org.uk "CITiZAN website"), the Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network.

**Friday 9 &amp; 23 March, 10am&ndash;12 noon**

Martyrs&rsquo; Writing Group: Writers of fiction or non-fiction can use the gallery space free of charge for a calm, quiet, untutored drop-in session, inspired by the current exhibition (bring own materials and refreshments). 

Read Alex Leith's interview with Cliff Crawford in the March edition of [Viva Lewes](http://www.vivabrighton.com/viva-lewes "Viva Lewes website") (Focus On&hellip;).
