## ALISON ALLUM: <cite>IN HER SHOES</cite>

**Exhibition: 5&ndash;25 May, 12 noon&ndash;5pm (Thu&ndash;Sun)**

Experimental glass artist Alison Allum exploits her medium&rsquo;s qualities of allure, fragility and danger to explore the contradictory experiences of modern womanhood. Combining classic beauty with a knowing theatricality, her collection of glass shoes and drawings portrays a much fetishised aspect of femininity and tempers it with an undercurrent of radicalism and wit.

**Friday 4 May, 6pm**

<cite>Private View:</cite> Refreshments from 6pm.
