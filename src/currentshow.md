## <cite>FRESH AiR 18</cite>

**10&ndash;11 February, 17&ndash;18 February, 24&ndash;25 February, 12 noon&ndash;4pm**

Our artist-in-residence programme is back for a 3rd iteration, featuring 3 very different artists, each inviting you to share and contribute to their experimental art practice.

From 5 February, **Pippa Ward** will be working in the gallery with found objects and reclaimed plastic waste, playing with form, texture and colour to explore our use of &ndash; and relationship with &ndash; disposable materials. Pippa will be sharing the outcome of her experiments in a two-day pop-up show on Saturday 10 and Sunday 11 February. See more of Pippa&rsquo;s work at [https://vimeo.com/116206307](https://vimeo.com/116206307 "Have you brought your own bags?").

From 12 February, Glynde-based **Jacky Misson** presents <cite>99 Ways to Map a Walk</cite>, an immersive installation that will retell 99 people&rsquo;s versions of the same walk through Lewes. Visitors to the gallery on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings are invited to contribute to Jacky&rsquo;s preparation for the final installation, which is on show on Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 February. Read more on Jacky&rsquo;s blog at [https://jackymisson.com/](https://jackymisson.com/ "Jacky Misson Website").

Finally, **Tamsin Spargo** brings her London-based practice to Lewes from 19 February, when she will cover the gallery in paper and begin a week of drawing as part of a very public process. Visitors to the gallery throughout the week are invited to add, subtract, create or destroy alongside her, in a process that weathers her drawings and subverts their meaning. Meet Tamsin from Tuesday to Saturday and see her work on display until Sunday 25 February.
